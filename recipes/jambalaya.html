        <h2>There is nothing like a pot of Jambalaya to get your tastebuds going. This super flavorful dish combines chunks of chicken, andouille sausage, and shrimp with rice and Creole seasoning for the ultimate one-pot dish that is surprisingly easy to make!</h3>
        
        <p>This Creole Jambalaya recipe is one that I have been perfecting over the years and it is not only easy to make but incredibly delicious while attempting to be as authentic as possible.</p>
        
        <p>It is great to serve around Mardi Gras time, but I make it all year long because it truly is a family favorite.</p>

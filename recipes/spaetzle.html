        <h2>Spaetzle is a traditional German egg noodle that is so easy to make and with just a few ingredients. It is the perfect side to so many main courses, especially those with rich gravy. Once you see how quickly it comes together you will want to make it all the time!</h3>
        
        <p>When it comes to German food, homemade spaetzle is one of the easiest you can make and since it is made with kitchen staples, you really can make it at any time.</p>
        
        <p>These German egg noodles are perfect alongside other traditional German dishes such as sauerbraten, beef rouladen, and red cabbage. And since it is similar to Hungarian nokedli, you can also serve it with dishes like chicken paprikash.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional, traditional)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk (plus more if needed)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter (for sautéing after boiling, optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish, optional)</li>
        </ul>



        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and nutmeg.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and milk together.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, stirring until a thick, sticky batter forms. Let it rest for 10–15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Press the batter through a spaetzle maker, colander with large holes, or a slotted spoon into the boiling water.</li>
            <li>Cook the spaetzle for 2–3 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Use a slotted spoon to remove them and transfer to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Optional: In a skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add cooked spaetzle and sauté until lightly golden.</li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped parsley if desired, and serve warm as a side or main dish.</li>
        </ol>
